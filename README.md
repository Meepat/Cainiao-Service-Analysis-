Consumer satisfaction plays a large role in a company being successful, particularly for delivery companies. Customers generally gravitate toward using companies that receive high ratings because they are indicative of providing an exceptional quality of service. Given this information, we were immediately drawn to the reviews variable of the data set. We aimed to use this variable as a measure of customer satisfaction, and ultimately wanted to test what factors, if any, have an influence on consumer ratings. 


To begin our analysis, we first turned to the “if_cainiao” variable. Some quick background research informed us that Cainiao is a logistics company based out of China. The company is used by delivery services in order to track packages. We assumed that this company would increase the accuracy of delivery time predictions, thus making merchants more confident in their promised delivery times. Prior knowledge of the subject matter reminded us that customers often view short promised delivery periods as a perk. For example, many consumers are loyal to Amazon as a result of their ability to accurately predict and follow through on one and two-day Prime deliveries. We hypothesized that customers would react favorably to other delivery promises as well, so we tested how the number of promises made varied based on whether or not Cainiao was used.


Our tests using R Software showed that more promises were in fact made when cainiao was used. (Figure 1) illustrates that 13,326 promises were made on orders using Cainiao, while only 38 promises were made on all other orders. To quantify this data, those numbers account for roughly 3.64% of Cainiao orders and 0.004% of non-Cainiao orders respectively. Although both of these percentages are small, the 3.64% of Cainiao is 900x larger than the 0.004% of the rest of the orders. While we cannot necessarily prove that Cainiao was the cause for this discrepancy, we can say that delivery promises are much more likely on Cainiao orders. 
The next logical step in our analysis was to see if Cainiao effectively delivers on their promises. We evaluated this by examining the average delivery times for the two different fulfillment groups. With more promises being made, we hypothesized that the orders placed using Cainiao would have a faster average delivery time than other orders. Our results supported our predictions. When cainiao was used, delivery times were quicker by an average of almost ten hours (Figure 2). A two-sided t-test was conducted to confirm that this difference between the two groups is significant .The p-value was nearly 0, which is beneath the 0.05 required for a 95% confidence interval.


Once we observed this difference, we continued to question whether the shorter delivery time was achieved solely to meet promises that were made, or if delivery times happened to be faster on their own. We reexamined the dataset after filtering to orders where no promises were made and obtained similar results. The average delivery time for Cainiao deliveries with no promise was slightly higher at around 62.4 hours, and the average delivery time for non-Cainiao orders did not change. This makes sense since very few orders placed for this fulfillment group had promises made in the first place. Additional t-tests confirmed that this difference was also significant, but that there was no significant change between the two average delivery times for the Caniano groups (p-value of 0.08).
Regardless of the differences observed between delivery times for Cainiao and non-Cainiao groups, we were surprised that both groups did not have higher promise rates. All average delivery times fall within the maximum promise range for this data set of 72 hours, so we would have anticipated a higher rate of promises. However, since the degree of customer satisfaction was the primary focus of our study, we only cared about evaluating promises and delivery times relative to their effect on average reviews. This was the last part of our analysis on the Cainiao variable and the results greatly surprised us.
Despite having a higher promise rate AND a faster average delivery period, reviews for Cainiao orders were lower on average when compared to other orders (Figure 3). These results go against our initial hypothesis that Cainiao orders would have more favorable reviews due to their ability to make more accurate predictions on delivery times. At this point in our research, we were unable to infer why our results did not match our hypothesis, so we continued to test further. We divided average reviews into two groups based on whether or not a promise was made and obtained the following results. 
When a promise was made, reviews for Cainiao orders were 0.17 points higher on average, but when promises were not made, the average review for Cainiao orders was 0.02 points lower than that of other orders. From this information, we inferred that people have higher expectations for predictions made with Cainiao. Since Cainiao is supposed to help with tracking orders, it is likely that consumers depend more on these predictions. They generally react favorably when promises can be made accurately and followed through, but are more disappointed when a promise is unable to be made. All in all, customers seem to have higher expectations for orders placed using Cainiao, and their degree of satisfaction seems to reflect these expectations. 
While we can make predictions based on our data and results, it is important to note that our data has many limitations. One limitation in particular that stands out is that review is an optional field. Not all customers are required to leave a review and many did not. Given this information, it is difficult to conduct a complete analysis and the results that we obtained might be skewed. People who had middling experiences might feel much less motivated to leave a review than those that had notably positive or negative ones. We simply cannot assume that the reviews we have are an accurate representation of the entire consumer base in the dataset, but since both groups were equally affected by the limitation, we trust that our analysis provided some intuitive data regarding Cainiao and the degree to which it influences customer satisfaction.
